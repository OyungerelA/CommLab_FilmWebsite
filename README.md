Project: Filming a Film 

Description: This is a website centered around a film that was created and edited in 30 minutes. It has four pages: Homepage, Cast Information, Production Process and Critic Reviews. I went for a quirky and fun concept to reflect the witty nature of our film, so I used a simple design with vibrant colors and a comical font. 

Process: I implemented the website by dividing each of the pages into flex boxes so that the center box is the largest and attracts the most attention. I used CSS to add more design elements, such as hover effect and alignments. I also incorporated a simple Javascript code to add interactivity, specifically in displaying the plot after a click. 

Reflection: I strictly followed my initial wireframe so I can say that my final website is quite close to my expectations. There is only one thing I could not accomplish, which was to alternate the reviews and the stars so that at first the review is followed by the stars and next time it's the stars followed by the review. If I could add more to my website, I would strive for more interactive elements so that it becomes a bit more fun. Overall, the project was super enjoyable and I learned a lot from it!
