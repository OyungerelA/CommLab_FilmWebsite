			<h3>Idea</h3>
			<p class="info">
				Since we had quite a trouble trying to decide on a topic, our film depicts 
				an almost alternate reality where everything goes smoothly and we are able to come 
				up with an idea rather quickly. This film idea was first initiated by our teammate, 
				Minnie Mouse, and our group as a whole all liked it and decided to continue with it. 
			</p>

			<h3>Filming Process</h3>
			<p class="info">
				Our filming took about 15 minutes and we recorded it using Zoom. We spent 
				another 10-15 minutes searching for and adding the background song using iMovie. 
			</p>

			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p class="info">
				 Although filming and editing a film in half an hour was a little stressful, it was a great 
				 experience overall and we had a lot of fun making our movie. We could not include 
				 everything we planned because of the time constraints, but sharing our film with our class and
				 watching other films of our classmates' was super enjoyable. At the end of the day, it is the
				 experience that matters, not the outcome :)
